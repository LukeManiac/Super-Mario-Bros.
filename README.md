## Installation

### Requirements
To run the game, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Issues
Unfortunately, controller support is not fully working in pygame so you'll need some kind of tools to convert joystick buttons to keyboard buttons. Click [here](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro/releases/download/2.24-final/antimicro-2.24-win64.msi) to get me!
