# Super Mario Bros. for Python

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to **Super Mario Bros. for Python** — a fully-fledged recreation of the legendary **Super Mario Bros.** game, built entirely in Python!

This project, passionately developed by **LukeManiac** (yes, that's me!), is my personal take on bringing the timeless magic of one of the most beloved platformers into the world of programming. Powered by the **`pygame` library**, the game offers smooth gameplay, nostalgic visuals, and a faithful retro experience. 

From **jumping over Goombas** to **smashing bricks for coins**, every core mechanic has been carefully implemented to provide a customizable and endlessly expandable experience. Whether you're here to **relive the classic Mario adventure**, **learn Python game development**, or **mod your own worlds**, you're in for a fun ride!

## ⚡ Modded Experience Note

If you plan to **mod the game heavily** (adding new sprites, levels, mechanics, etc.), it's **highly recommended** to package your project into a standalone `.exe` file after making major changes.  

This ensures that custom content loads correctly and prevents dependency issues that can occur when sharing or running the modded game.

### 🛠 Recommended Tool

- [**auto-py-to-exe**](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) — A simple, graphical tool for converting your Python scripts into executable files.

## Installation

### 📌 System Requirements

Before installing, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x** – The game is written in Python, so you'll need a recent version of Python installed.
- **Pygame Library** – This game is powered by `pygame`, so you must install it before running the game.

### 🔧 Installation Steps

1. Download Python
- If you don’t have Python installed, download the latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it.

2. Install Pygame
- Open a terminal or command prompt and run: `pip install pygame`
- This will install the pygame library, which is essential for running the game.

3. Download the Game Files
- Download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it, place it in the game directory folder.

4. Run the Game

## Issues & Workarounds

### 🎮 Controller Support

While `pygame` does support gamepads, **its controller support is not perfect**, and certain controllers may not work properly without additional software. If you experience issues with button mapping or unresponsive inputs, you may need a **third-party key remapping tool**.

#### 🛠 Recommended Solution:

- **[AntiMicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro/releases/download/2.24-final/antimicro-2.24-win64.msi)** – This tool allows you to remap gamepad inputs to keyboard keys, making it easy to play with any controller.
