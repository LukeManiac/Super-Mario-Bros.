# Super Mario Bros. for Python

## Overview

Welcome to **Super Mario Bros. for Python**, a fully-fledged recreation of the legendary **Super Mario Bros.** game, built entirely in Python. This project, passionately developed by **LukeManiac** (yes, that's me!), is a personal take on bringing the magic of one of the most beloved platformers of all time into the world of Python programming. The game is powered by the **`pygame` library**, which provides robust tools for handling rendering, player input, and audio management, ensuring smooth gameplay and a faithful retro experience. From **jumping over Goombas** to **smashing bricks for coins**, every fundamental mechanic of the classic game has been carefully implemented to provide a nostalgic yet customizable experience. Whether you're here to **relive the classic Mario experience**, **tinker with Python game development**, or even **mod the game to add your own creative touch**, this project is designed to be fun, flexible, and endlessly expandable!

## Issues & Workarounds

### 🎮 Controller Support

While `pygame` does support gamepads, **its controller support is not perfect**, and certain controllers may not work properly without additional software. If you experience issues with button mapping or unresponsive inputs, you may need a **third-party key remapping tool**.

#### 🛠 Recommended Solution:

- **[AntiMicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro/releases/download/2.24-final/antimicro-2.24-win64.msi)** – This tool allows you to remap gamepad inputs to keyboard keys, making it easy to play with any controller.
