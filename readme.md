## 🕹️ Features

### 🎬 Epic Intro Screen with Secret Code

An introductory screen sets the scene before the game begins – but enter the Konami Code before the screen fades and you'll start with permanent invincibility! A fun and rewarding nod for retro lovers and power users alike.

### 🎮 Smooth Control Customization

Select a player and watch them gracefully scale and glide into the center-right of the screen. This intuitive system allows you to assign and test new controls on the fly with responsive feedback and sleek animations.

### 🔁 Dynamic Loop Point System

Background music can loop with custom timestamps, giving each course its own rhythm and ambiance. Seamless audio transitions enhance immersion and allow composers to fine-tune the audio experience.

### 🖼️ Advanced Texture Manager

Swap and personalize backgrounds, music, sound effects, sprite sheets, and even character properties. The texture manager gives you full creative control over your game’s visuals and audio styling.

### 📦 Course Pack Integration

Plug and play with custom course packs that bundle levels, assets, and logic together. Share your worlds with others or install packs made by the community to experience new challenges.

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support

The engine comes with built-in language files and allows you to add custom ones. Strings are auto-added to your language file if missing, ensuring nothing breaks even during development.

### ⚡ Power Meter System

A real-time power meter visual shows how close you are to achieving maximum speed. Customize the visuals in your own texture packs at any time for a uniquely themed HUD.

### 🎥 Adjustable Camera Smoothness

You can tweak the camera smoothing to match your playstyle. Whether you prefer fast-snapping action or a cinematic floaty scroll, you’re in control of how the screen follows you.

### 💾 Real-Time Save Data System

Every frame is auto-saved during gameplay, ensuring your progress is protected from crashes or power outages. It’s like having invisible checkpoints at every step!

### 🌈 Custom Starman Effects

Star power now triggers fully editable visual effects, with sprite color blending and star particle animations that can be modded per texture pack or game state.

### 🧩 Modding Support

You can submit your own full mods of this script to LukeManiac for review. If your mod needs improvement, you’ll get helpful suggestions. If it’s ready, it could become an official add-on!

### 🌟 All Super Mario Maker 2 Items

From the Ice Flower to fan-favorite fangame inventions, this feature will introduce a wide collection of power-ups and items directly inspired by community creations and Nintendo classics.

### 🏗️ Custom Course Builder

Design your own levels using an in-game interface similar to Super Mario Maker! Place blocks, enemies, and terrain elements, then playtest instantly.
